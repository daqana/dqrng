Description: Several fast random number generators are provided as C++
  header only libraries: The PCG family by O'Neill (2014
  <https://www.cs.hmc.edu/tr/hmc-cs-2014-0905.pdf>) as well as
  Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ by Blackman and Vigna (2018
  <arXiv:1805.01407>). In addition fast functions for generating random
  numbers according to a uniform, normal and exponential distribution
  are included. The latter two use the Ziggurat algorithm originally
  proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>).
  The fast sampling methods support weighted and unweighted sampling both with 
  and without replacement. For weighted sampling  a stochastic acceptance method
  suggested by Lipowski and Lipowska (2012, <doi:10.1016/j.physa.2011.12.004>)
  is used. These functions are exported to R and as a C++ interface and are
  enabled for use with the default 64 bit generator from the PCG family,
  Xoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ as well as the 64 bit version of the 20 rounds
  Threefry engine (Salmon et al., 2011, <doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405>) as
  provided by the package 'sitmo'.
